Special note on CSV files:

I recognise that university names can be inconsistent (i.e. Stephen F Austin vs. Stephen F. Austin vs. SFA).

This is something that I'll eventually remedy! 

Unfortunately, making these names consistent within each year was difficult enough -- data was gathered from multiple sources, and many listed a number of colleges differently.
To make matters worse, many of these same sources listed colleges/universities differently between different years, adding further layers of messiness.
While these sources are highly useful, this does make matters difficult when seeking to collect data and make it accessible for analysis -- something I hope the publication of this dataset helps with, even if it's not completely perfect (yet).
